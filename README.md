# DCN Bonus Assignment 2: Implementing the Dijkstra algorithm
Implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm in python.

The report is given in report.pdf and the code in Dijkstra.py.

# Using Dijkstra.py
The code mainly consists of the dijkstra algorithm (function dijkstra()) and a graph plotter (function graph()).

Further description of the functions and the format of the parameters can be found in the docstring.

To get the code minimally working the only thing that is required is to run the function run_example()
